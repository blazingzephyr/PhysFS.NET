# PhysFS.NET
 High-level wrapper + low-level bindings for PhysFS for C#.<br/>
 Currently [/PhysFS.NET/API/PhysFS.cs](/PhysFS.NET/API/PhysFS.cs) and [/PhysFS.NET/Internals/Globals.cs](/PhysFS.NET/Internals/Globals.cs) are not completely finished and lack some crucial methods which are gonna be supported soon.<br/>
 In the meantime, please report any issues encountered with the rest of the API!
